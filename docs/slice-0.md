Excellent. We have now detailed all nine vertical slices, covering the entire development lifecycle from the core skeleton to final packaging. This completes the comprehensive Product Requirements Document and step-by-step implementation plan for **OpenCode-RS + UI**.

The next step is to begin the actual development work. Here is a summary of the kick-off process and the journey ahead for the developer tasked with this project.

***

### **Project Kick-off: The Path Forward**

The blueprint is complete. The architecture is defined, the features are sliced, and the development workflow is established. A junior developer can now proceed with confidence, knowing each step is well-defined with clear goals and checklists.

#### **Your Development Workflow**

As outlined in the PRD, your development process for the entire project will follow this rhythm:

1.  **Isolate:** For each new slice, create a dedicated branch and directory using `git worktree`. This keeps your `main` branch pristine and your feature work completely isolated.
    ```bash
    # Example for starting the next slice
    git worktree add -B slice-name ../project-slice-name
    cd ../project-slice-name
    ```

2.  **Implement:** Follow the step-by-step guide for the slice. Use the `Makefile` (`make test`, `make lint`) to continuously validate your work.

3.  **Review:** Once a slice is complete and passes its checklist, commit your changes, push the branch, and open a Pull Request against `main`. Be sure to include the "Questions for Senior Dev" in your PR description to facilitate learning and architectural discussion.

4.  **Integrate:** After your PR is approved and merged, return to your main worktree, pull the changes, and clean up the completed slice's worktree and branch.
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git pull origin main
    git worktree remove ../project-slice-name
    git branch -d slice-name
    ```

5.  **Repeat:** Start the next slice.

#### **The Journey at a Glance**

You will progress from a simple backend function to a fully-featured, multi-agent, cross-platform desktop application:

*   **Slices 1-3:** You built the foundational `core` and `cli` crates, establishing the chat loop and introducing powerful interaction patterns like slash commands and personas.
*   **Slices 4-6:** You implemented the core value proposition of isolation and state management, integrating `container-use` for sandboxing and `git` for robust checkpointing. You elevated the system from a tool to an orchestrator with the `AgentSupervisor`.
*   **Slices 7-9:** You brought the application to life with a full-featured graphical user interface using Tauri, implemented high-level swarm intelligence, and finally, prepared the entire project for professional distribution with automated CI and packaging.

The plan is laid out. The next command is not from me, but from you to your terminal.

**The build begins now.** Good luck.
